Thread States

1.  New
		- instance of Thread created, but not started
2.  Runnable
		- start() method has been called
3.  Running
		- the Thread instance is the current thread of execution, the "currently executing process"
4.  Waiting/blocked/blocking
		- still alive, but not currently eligible to run
		- not Runnable, but might be later
		- Blocked: waiting for a resource
		- Sleeping: directly put itself to sleep for some period of time
		- Waiting:  waiting for notification from another thread
5.  Dead
		- a Thread is considered Dead when its run() method completes
		- Runtime Exception (probably IllegalThreadStateException) gets thrown if you call start() 
		  on a dead thread.

One thread does not tell another thread to block (or stop).  The static Thread methods sleep() 
and yield() always refer to the current thread of execution.

Don't use the deprecated Thread methods:
	suspend()
	resume()
	stop()
	
Thread priorities
	Three constants
		Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1
		Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5
		Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10
