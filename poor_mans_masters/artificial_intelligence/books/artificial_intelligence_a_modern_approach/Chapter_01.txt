Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig

AI attempts to understand and build intelligent entities

	- diagnosing diseases



1.1 What is AI
==============

Thinking Humanly		Thinking Rationally

Acting Humanly			Acting Rationally



1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach
----------------------------------------------

Alan Turing, Turing Test

In order to pass the Turing Test, a system would need:
 - natural language processing
 - knowledge representation
 - automated reasoning
 - machine learning

 Additionally, to pass the "total Turing test," a system would need:
  - computer vision
  - robotics



1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
-------------------------------------------------------

Cognitive Science - The inderdisciplinary field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the human mind.

Computer vision is an example of a field in which cognitive science and artificial intelligence have pushed eachother to new achievement.



1.1.3 Thinking rationally: The "laws of thought" approach
---------------------------------------------------------

 - Aristotle's syllogisms
 - Logic
 - Logicist tradition within the artificial intelligence field



1.1.4 Acting rationally: The rational agent approach
----------------------------------------------------

Agents...
  - operate autonomously
  - perceive their environment
  - persist over a prolonged time period
  - adapt to change
  - create and pursue goals

 ...recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action that is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deloberation.

 ...achieving perfect rationality - always doing the right thing - is not feasible in complicated environments.  The computational demands are just too high.

 Limited Rationality - acting appropriately when there is not enough time to do all the computations one might like



1.2  The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
===============================================

1.2.1 Philosophy
----------------

   - Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
   - How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
   - Where does knowledge come from?
   - How does knowledge lead to action?

   Aristotle - first to formulate a precise set of laws governing the rational part of the mind, syllogisms for proper reasoning

   First "thinking machines" were mathematical calculators by DaVinci, Pascal, Leibniz

   - Rationalism - emphasis on the power of reason to understand the world
   - Dualism - part of the humand mind is outside of nature and exempt from physical laws
   - Materialism - the brain's operation according to the laws of physics constitutes the mind - free will is simply how we perceive choice
   - Empiricism - "Nothing is in the understanding, which was not first in the senses." - John Locke
   - Induction - general rules are acquired by exposure to repeated associations...
   - Logical Positivism and Observation Sentences - combines rationalism and empiricism
   - Confirmation Theory - theory of mind as a computational process

   Regression planning system, goal-based analysis



1.2.2 Mathematics
-----------------

 - Logic - What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
 - Computation - What can be computed?
 - Probability - How do we reason with uncertain information?

First algorithm - Euclid's algorithm for computing greatest common divisors

Godel's incompleteness theorem - some functions on the integers cannon be represented by an algorithm => not computable

Tractability - A problem is called intractable if the time required to solve instances of the problem grows exponentially with the size of the instances.  It's a distinction between polynomial and exponential growth

NP-Completeness

Probability



1.2.3 Economics
---------------

 - How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
 - How should we do this when others may not go along?
 - How should we do this when the payof may be far in the future?

Adam Smith

Utility - preferred outcomes - "When McDonald's offers a hamburger for a dollar, they are asserting that they would prefer the dollar and hoping that customers will prefer the hambrger."
