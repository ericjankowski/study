Chapter 1
1.1
    - Unit testing has been around since the 1970's.
    - Kent Beck introduced it in Smalltalk.
1.2
    - A unit test should have the following properties
        - It should be automated and repeatable.
        - It should be easy to implement.
        - It should be relevant tomorrow.
        - Anyone should be able to run it at the push of a button.
        - It should run quickly.
        - It should be consistent in its results (it always returns the same result if you donâ€™t change anything between runs).
        - It should have full control of the unit under test.
        - It should be fully isolated (runs independently of other tests).
        - When it fails, it should be easy to detect what was expected and determine how to pinpoint the problem.
