Introduction
------------

Great managers actively learn the craft of management.


Week One - Learning about the People and the Work
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to lead people, you have to know them: their unique strengths, aspirations and patterns of behavior.

3 things
- Who are the people and what are they working on?
- What is the stated mission of the group and how does the group provide value?
- How does the group fit into the larger organization?

Ask open-ended questions.

If you offer help, you need to follow through and provide the help requested.

Gather Data about Current Work

Types of work
- Project work has a start and an end and meets specific organizational goals
- Ad hoc work is work that appears to come from nowhere - a crisis, an unanticipated request, or other work that wasn't planned
- Ongoing work keeps the business and the operation running
- Periodic work happens at predictable intervals
- Management work encompasses the planning and organization of the rest of the work

Value of work
- Who will use this?
- When is it needed?
- What's the result if we don't provide it?


Week Two - Bringing Order to the Chaos
--------------------------------------

Understand what everyone is working on, articulate priorities, and choose only the work that supports the goals of the group and the organization.

You can't make decisions about priority if you don't understand the department's goals.

Categorize all the projects
- Projects and work you know will continue
- Projects and work you know you need to stop
- Projects and work that may be important but may not fit in your group
- Projects and work that you don't know where they fit

Closely monitor those last two categories and discuss them with your manager/team/others.


Week Three - Building the Team
------------------------------

When managers don't have shared goals, they tend to optimize their own functions, often at the expense of the department's overall goals.

When identifying conflicts and trying to resolve them, we want all parties to agree on as much data as possible and find a way to move forward.

Provide Timely Feedback
- Provide feedback as close to the event as pssible
- Deliver feedback in private
- Describe the behavior or result- Evaluations are different from feedback
- Listen to what the other person has to say
- Keep notes of feedback conversations
