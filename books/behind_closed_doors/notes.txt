Week One - Learning about the People and the Work
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to lead people, you have to know them: their unique strengths, aspirations and patterns of behavior.

3 things
- Who are the people and what are they working on?
- What is the stated mission of the group and how does the group provide value?
- How does the group fit into the larger organization?

Ask open-ended questions.

If you offer help, you need to follow through and provide the help requested.

Gather Data about Current Work

Types of work
- Project work has a start and an end and meets specific organizational goals
- Ad hoc work is work that appears to come from nowhere - a crisis, an unanticipated request, or other work that wasn't planned
- Ongoing work keeps the business and the operation running
- Periodic work happens at predictable intervals
- Management work encompasses the planning and organization of the rest of the work

Value of work
- Who will use this?
- When is it needed?
- What's the result if we don't provide it?
